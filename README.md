#Contact Us Page â€“ Django + React

This Contact Us page is built using Django (backend) and React (frontend) to provide a dynamic and efficient way for users to reach out. It features a form where visitors can submit their inquiries, which are then processed and stored in the Django backend.
Key Features:

    React Frontend: A modern, responsive form built with React, ensuring a seamless user experience.

    Django Backend: Handles form submissions, stores data in a database, and can send emails for notifications.

    API Integration: Uses Django REST Framework (DRF) to communicate between React and Django.
